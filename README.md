COMPILATION:

-> To compile the program, JDK is required

-> Instructions on installing and configuring JDK can be found at :

   https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/linux_jdk.html

-> To compile the program run the command "javac ExoRedis.java" on the directory

RUNNING:

-> Before running the program all the class files must have execution permission

-> "chmod +x *" on the directory would suffice

-> To run ExoRedis type "java ExoRedis <DB filename>" on the installed directory

-> If no DB filename is present exoredis.rdb would be the default filename

-> ExoRedis can be connected via a telnet client on the port 15000

-> "telnet localhost 15000" would telnet to ExoRedis

-> ctrl + c or SIGINT can be used to terminate the execution of the ExoRedis server
